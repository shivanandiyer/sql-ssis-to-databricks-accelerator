# Review Required: OLTP:Website.RecordColdRoomTemperatures

- **Object type:** PROCEDURE
- **Source file:** /Users/shivaiyer/Documents/Claude/sql-server-samples/samples/databases/wide-world-importers/wwi-ssdt/wwi-ssdt/Website/Stored Procedures/RecordColdRoomTemperatures.sql
- **Classification:** MANUAL_REDESIGN

## Why this needs manual review

- WHILE loop — rewrite as a vectorised DataFrame operation, or, if iterating a small fixed list (e.g. years), a Python for-loop generating one MERGE per iteration.
- TRY/CATCH — replace with Python try/except in the PySpark task, or Workflow task-level retry/failure handling.
