# Review Required: OLTP:Integration.GetEmployeeUpdates

- **Object type:** PROCEDURE
- **Source file:** /Users/shivaiyer/Documents/Claude/sql-server-samples/samples/databases/wide-world-importers/wwi-ssdt/wwi-ssdt/Integration/Stored Procedures/GetEmployeeUpdates.sql
- **Classification:** MANUAL_REDESIGN

## Why this needs manual review

- CURSOR — row-by-row processing; rewrite as a set-based DataFrame transformation (groupBy/window functions) or, if truly row-oriented, a Python loop over a collected (small) result set.
- WHILE loop — rewrite as a vectorised DataFrame operation, or, if iterating a small fixed list (e.g. years), a Python for-loop generating one MERGE per iteration.
- Temp table — replace with a PySpark DataFrame (if used only within the procedure body) or a Delta table in a scratch/staging schema (if state must persist across steps).
- Orchestration-heavy procedure split per conversion rule 4: SQL transformation logic and workflow orchestration logic are emitted as separate files.
