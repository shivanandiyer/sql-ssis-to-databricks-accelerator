# Review Required: OLTP:Application.Configuration_ApplyFullTextIndexing

- **Object type:** PROCEDURE
- **Source file:** /Users/shivaiyer/Documents/Claude/sql-server-samples/samples/databases/wide-world-importers/wwi-ssdt/wwi-ssdt/Application/Stored Procedures/Configuration_ApplyFullTextIndexing.sql
- **Classification:** PARTIAL_AUTOMATION

## Why this needs manual review

- No executable SQL statement could be extracted from this procedure's body — this usually means it uses a construct our extractor doesn't recognise (e.g. OPENJSON, a non-standard DML shape) rather than that it has no logic. MANUAL REVIEW REQUIRED before deployment; do not treat this as a safe no-op.
