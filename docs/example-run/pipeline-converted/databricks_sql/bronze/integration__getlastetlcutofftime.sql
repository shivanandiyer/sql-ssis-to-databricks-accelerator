-- Split 1 of 2: SQL transformation logic extracted from an orchestration-heavy
-- stored procedure (rule: separate SQL transformation from workflow orchestration).
-- The CURSOR/WHILE control flow that drove row-by-row iteration in the source is
-- NOT reproduced here — see the companion PySpark orchestration file, which expresses
-- the same iteration as a set-based MERGE or a small parameterised loop.

-- -- TODO: no top-level DML auto-extracted; review source body and CURSOR loop body above.
