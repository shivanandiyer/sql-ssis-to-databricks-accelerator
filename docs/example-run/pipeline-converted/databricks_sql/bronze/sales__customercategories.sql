-- Conversion notes:
-- Column `CustomerCategoryID` used IDENTITY/NEXT VALUE FOR in the source — replace with a Delta
-- `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY` column or a surrogate-key generation step in the loading pipeline
-- (see target_state_architecture.md, Unity Catalog section).
-- Column `ValidFrom` is a SQL Server system-versioning period column (GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW
-- START/END) — dropped from the Delta DDL. NOTE: Delta Time Travel (VERSION/TIMESTAMP AS OF) is NOT
-- equivalent to this column's semantics — Time Travel returns the whole table's state at a commit,
-- while this column tracks each row's own validity window independent of write/commit history. Any
-- query that did `... FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF @ts` must be rewritten as an explicit point-in-time filter
-- (`WHERE valid_from <= @ts AND (valid_to > @ts OR valid_to IS NULL)`) against the still-present
-- ValidFrom/ValidTo columns — not replaced with Delta Time Travel. MANUAL REVIEW REQUIRED.
-- Column `ValidTo` is a SQL Server system-versioning period column (GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW START/END)
-- — dropped from the Delta DDL. NOTE: Delta Time Travel (VERSION/TIMESTAMP AS OF) is NOT equivalent to
-- this column's semantics — Time Travel returns the whole table's state at a commit, while this column
-- tracks each row's own validity window independent of write/commit history. Any query that did `...
-- FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF @ts` must be rewritten as an explicit point-in-time filter (`WHERE valid_from
-- <= @ts AND (valid_to > @ts OR valid_to IS NULL)`) against the still-present ValidFrom/ValidTo
-- columns — not replaced with Delta Time Travel. MANUAL REVIEW REQUIRED.
-- Foreign key not enforced by Delta Lake (informational only): CONSTRAINT
-- [FK_Sales_CustomerCategories_Application_People] FOREIGN KEY ([LastEditedBy]) REFERENCES
-- [Application].[Peopl
-- Source table used SQL Server temporal tables (FOR SYSTEM_TIME / paired _Archive table). Recommended
-- replacement: enable `delta.enableChangeDataFeed` and query history via `TIMESTAMP AS OF` / `VERSION
-- AS OF`, or `table_changes()`. The paired _Archive table is converted separately and should be
-- reconciled with this table's Delta history rather than kept as a second physical table long-term.
